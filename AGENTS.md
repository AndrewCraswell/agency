# AGENTS.md

## Permission to change guidance

Treat repository rules, agent instructions, skills, and best practices as read-only unless the user explicitly
authorizes a concrete change. This covers this rule itself, every `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, instructions loaded
from other files, and everything in [best-practices/](best-practices/README.md). It applies to creating, editing,
formatting, moving, renaming, and deleting protected files, including changes made by tools or scripts.

When permission is needed, show the proposed changes in a table with **File**, **Before**, and **After** columns.
Give the exact affected wording or paths, with a row for each change. For additions or deletions, mark the absent
side as “absent.” Ask for approval of that table and wait before applying it. If the user has already explicitly
authorized the concrete change, apply only that change. A feature request, review, or failing check does not authorize
changing the rules.

## Repository instructions

- Start at the [best-practices index](best-practices/README.md). For every code change, apply the
  [coding principles](best-practices/principles.md) and [conventions](best-practices/conventions.md).
- Check the [preferred tech stack](best-practices/tech-stack.md) and discuss new libraries before adding them.

## Copy and UX

- Review every new or changed user-facing string with at least one writing skill before opening a PR. Use
  [writing-style-guide](.agents/skills/writing-style-guide/SKILL.md) for interface text, including labels, errors,
  empty states, and accessible names. Use [copy-editing](.agents/skills/copy-editing/SKILL.md) for marketing copy.
  Apply [brand-voice](.agents/skills/brand-voice/SKILL.md) when shaping the voice or
  [deslopify-writing](.agents/skills/deslopify-writing/SKILL.md) when checking for formulaic phrasing.
- When available, use Fluent Agent MCP to check customer-facing text against its content and interaction guidance.
  Report when the service is unavailable. Avoid dot glyphs as visual separators.
- Exercise changed user workflows in the running app with the integrated browser. Check desktop and mobile layouts,
  keyboard use, and accessible names.

## Documentation and data

- Update product documentation alongside behavior changes. Keep each page focused on one topic. Review prose, evidence
  ledgers, status tables, and narrative records directly. Reserve executable tests for code and generated artifacts
  that affect behavior, fabrication, or an external interface.
- Treat stale prototype data as disposable. Only migrate or repair it on explicit request. Preserve integration
  credentials and unrelated external configuration during a data reset unless the user explicitly requests a full reset.

## Before opening a PR

- When the change is ready for review, run the relevant focused checks, fix related failures together, and run
  `pnpm verify`.
- Only bypass a Git hook with explicit user permission for an unrelated failure. Run focused checks on the files
  being committed and report the blocker and checks in the handoff.

# Project-specific guidance

Project-specific requirements below take precedence over shared recommendations when they differ.

# AGENTS.md

Agent guidance for this repository lives in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md). Read it
before making changes.

Quick reference:

- **Lint:** `oxlint` (not eslint) · **Format:** `oxfmt` (not prettier)
- **Type-check:** TypeScript 7 RC native compiler via `pnpm check:types`
- **Test:** Vitest via `pnpm test` · **Build:** Vite via `pnpm build`
- **Package manager:** pnpm `>=11` on Node `>=24` · **Tasks:** Turborepo
- **Git hooks:** lefthook (pre-commit: `oxlint --fix` + `oxfmt`; pre-push: `check:types`). Don't use `--no-verify`.
- **Reuse first:** prefer `@mantine/hooks`, `ts-extras`, `ts-pattern`, and `tiny-invariant` over hand-rolled hooks /
  type helpers; narrow with type guards, not `as`.
- **Product copy:** never use `·`, `•`, or another dot glyph as a visual separator.
- **UX acceptance:** verify every UX change through the integrated browser before calling it complete. Component tests
  alone are not sufficient.

Verify loop (must be clean before finishing): run **`pnpm verify`** (format, lint, types, knip, tests with coverage).

# Agency Monorepo — Project Guidelines

A Turborepo + pnpm monorepo with React 19 and TypeScript applications. UI systems are selected at the app or
product-surface boundary. Shared config lives in `@repo/*` packages under `packages/`. See [README.md](README.md) for
setup and the [docs index](docs/README.md) for conventions.

## Tooling (differs from common defaults)

- **Lint:** `oxlint` (not eslint) · **Format:** `oxfmt` (not prettier).
- **Type-check:** `tsc` from a pinned native TypeScript — keep the version aligned across packages.
- **Test:** Vitest (jsdom unit + Storybook browser tests) · **Bundler/dev server:** Vite · **Workshop:** Storybook.
- **Package manager:** pnpm (`>=11`) on Node `>=24`, enforced via root `engines` + `engine-strict`.
- **Task runner:** Turborepo.

## Build / verify loop

Complete the coherent implementation before running unit tests, type-checks, lint, browser acceptance, or the full
verification suite. Do not run these checks after each small edit. Once the implementation is complete, run the smallest
relevant focused checks, then run the required final verification. If a check exposes related defects, batch the repairs
before rerunning that check.

Run `pnpm verify` before declaring work done — it must be clean. It runs `check` (oxfmt format + `oxlint` lint and `tsc`
type-check deferred per-package via Turbo + `knip` once over the whole graph) then `test:coverage`. Formatting is
global; lint and type-check are per-package; knip is root-only.

Git hooks (lefthook): **pre-commit** runs `oxlint --fix` + `oxfmt` on staged files; **pre-push** runs
`pnpm check:types`. Do not bypass them with `--no-verify` unless the user explicitly authorizes it for a failure wholly
caused by unrelated project work. That exception does not waive focused verification for the files being committed, and
the commit handoff must record the unrelated blocker and the checks run directly. The scoring-device and prototype-PCB
workstream currently has that permission for the unrelated legislation dependency-install failure.

## Workspace layout

- `apps/` — product applications.
- **Reusable shared config** (extend these; don't redefine per package): `@repo/oxlint-config`,
  `@repo/storybook-config`, `@repo/typescript-config`.

## Conventions

Coding conventions live in the [`docs/`](docs/README.md) folder — start at the index and read the relevant page before
writing code. Two points worth stating up front: the **React Compiler is on** (don't hand-write
`useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo`), and **reuse before building** — check the [hooks](docs/hooks.md) and
[type-helper](docs/typescript.md) catalogs before writing your own.

Prefer the tools in the [preferred tech stack](docs/tech-stack.md); **introducing a library that isn't already used
needs a human discussion**, not a silent add.

## Documentation

- **Keep this file brief** — it's the entry point; link to `docs/` articles rather than duplicating detail.
- **Prefer small, focused `docs/` pages**, and update them (and the [index](docs/README.md)) in the same change as the
  behavior they describe.
- Do not create executable validators or test suites for prose documentation, evidence ledgers, backlog/status tables,
  or narrative part-selection records. Review those artifacts directly. Tests should cover executable code and generated
  product artifacts whose correctness affects runtime behavior, fabrication, or an external interface.

## Product copy and UX acceptance

- Never use a dot glyph, including `·` or `•`, as a visual separator. Use layout, separate text elements, or a clearly
  worded phrase instead.
- Verify every new or changed UX feature in the integrated browser before considering it complete. Exercise the customer
  workflow, inspect the rendered result at desktop and mobile sizes, and check keyboard and accessible-name behavior.
  Unit or component tests do not replace this browser acceptance check.

## Gotchas

- Hosted on **GitHub** — use GitHub for PRs and issues.
- oxlint rules live in the shared `@repo/oxlint-config` base; add new rules there so every package benefits.

## Principles for development

- **Don't reinvent wheels.** [typescript.md](docs/typescript.md) and [hooks.md](docs/hooks.md) catalog what the
  installed libraries already provide. Check them before adding a hook or type helper.
- **One topic per page, kept short.** Prefer a new focused page over growing an existing one past a scannable length.
- **Docs stay current.** When behavior, tooling, or conventions change, update the relevant page (and this index) in the
  same change.
- Don't overtest or verify. Complete shippable units of work before running test passes and resolving failures. Test
  passes cost lots of time.
- Prefer correctness over expediency or backwards compatibility. If faced with an issue where the new behavior would
  create a breaking change, ask first whether it needs to be backwards compatible. If no user is available to answer,
  assume not.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Replace obsolete contracts and implementations directly.
- Do not create version-suffixed files, symbols, schemas, routes, or APIs such as `V2`, `Phase2`, `legacy`, or
  compatibility aliases. Keep one canonical implementation.
- Fix forward. Update the current implementation and its original migration baseline instead of adding compatibility
  migrations, data rewrites, shims, fallbacks, or dual paths for unreleased behavior.
- Prioritize correctness over expediency. Fix root causes and maintain coherent contracts even when resetting prototype
  state is faster than preserving it.
- Treat prototype data as disposable. Do not preserve, migrate, or repair stale workflow or execution data unless the
  user explicitly requests it. Prefer a clean database reset or targeted deletion of stale prototype records.
- Preserve integration credentials and unrelated external configuration when resetting application data unless the user
  explicitly requests a full reset.
- Complete the entire coherent deliverable before running tests, type-checks, lint, formatting checks, browser
  acceptance, or repository verification.
- After the deliverable is complete, run the smallest relevant focused checks, repair related failures in one batch, and
  then run the required final repository verification.
- Do not run verification after each incremental edit or partial implementation.
