# ESP32 scoring prototype work

## Goal

Order a deliberately simple ESP32-S3 scoring board that unlocks firmware development. The board is a hand-built
prototype, not a production design.

The retired 164-component carrier is not the implementation baseline. Its generated PCB, routing, BOM, and placement
outputs must not be advanced or ordered. Useful verified knowledge may be reused selectively in the replacement.

## Working rules

- The root agent performs all work; do not delegate prototype tasks to subagents.
- Start from a blank schematic and add only hardware required by
  [Minimal ESP32 scoring prototype](./clean-sheet-board-architecture.md).
- Do not route until every active IC and connector has a concrete prototype justification.
- Prefer modules, headers, solder pads, jumpers, and off-board power assemblies.
- Do not create validators, evidence packages, qualification artifacts, or production processes.
- Keep `Latest state` accurate whenever work is reviewed or committed.
- `done` requires implementation, focused verification, root review, and a commit.

## Remaining work

| Deliverable | Status | Latest state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replace the oversized carrier | active | Commits `8513c96` and `c4935f1` retire the previous architecture and delete its generated PCB/order outputs. The replacement is capped at 60 populated parts and 160 mm by 100 mm on two layers. Its complete active silicon is one socketed ESP32-S3 DevKitC, WIZ850io, TSOP38438, and two HUB75 buffers; the conductor interface starts with the simple discrete OpenPiste topology. Next: draw and root-review that schematic. |
| Produce the prototype PCB | waiting | Starts only after root simplicity review of the replacement schematic. Place and route the smallest practical board, run basic ERC/DRC, inspect Gerbers and drills, and order a small batch. Delete or replace obsolete generated outputs from the retired carrier. |
| Bind firmware to the ordered board | waiting | After the final pinout is fixed, connect the portable C17 scoring core to the real ESP32 acquisition and interface adapters. Avoid firmware for hypothetical hardware. |
| Bring up scoring behavior | waiting | Verify rails and programming, then Ethernet, IR, display, outputs, and all seven conductors. Exercise foil, epee, and sabre timing and resistance behavior and record only faults that require a board or firmware revision. |

## Fixed decisions

- One ESP32-S3 runs the prototype and portable C17 scoring core; there is no STM32 on this board.
- WIZ850io supplies Ethernet.
- USB-C PD remains the normal input through off-board SparkFun and Pololu modules.
- Ok Fencing weapon cables are already accepted; the prototype uses direct solder pads or simple board-side connections.
- Firmware follows the ordered hardware, except for continued development of the hardware-independent scoring logic.
